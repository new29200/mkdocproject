# ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

# How does the webhook verification work?

Shopify includes an X-Shopify-Hmac-SHA256 header with each webhook request. The server recalculates this hash and compares it to ensure the request's authenticity.

# What happens if an order fails to process?

Failed orders are logged, and a retry mechanism is in place. If the issue persists, an alert is triggered for manual review.

# How secure is the data transfer?

All API requests and webhook transmissions are encrypted using HTTPS (SSL/TLS). Sensitive credentials are stored in environment variables.

# Can I manually resend an order to the supplier?

Yes, orders that fail to send via FTP are stored in a queue and can be retried using a manual script.
